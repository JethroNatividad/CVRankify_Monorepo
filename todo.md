1. Include system performance analysis, such as time complexity and processing time, when screening at least 100 resumes, and compare it with the traditional manual screening method.

2. Optimize the ranking process by eliminating non-fit candidates early to reduce server overload. Suggestion: use required skills as a baseline filter.

3. Highlight the strengths of top-ranking applicants, for example: “Applicant 1 excels in education,” “Applicant 2 excels in experience,” etc., to provide detailed evaluation insights.

4. <s>Indicate in the system and report a limitation: to get a good ranking, the CV must be ATS-compliant, as non-compliant CVs may be under-ranked despite strong qualifications.</s>

5. <s>Clarify whether the system can handle non-traditional candidates (e.g., self-taught or bootcamp graduates who may lack formal education but have extensive portfolios). Suggestion: implement dynamic ranking with downweighting or upweighting of certain criteria.</s>

6. <s>Ensure that individual skill sets assigned by HR are also weighted in the ranking, not just the overall skill criteria, allowing for more nuanced candidate evaluation.</s>
