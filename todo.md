1. Include system performance analysis, such as time complexity and processing time, when screening at least 100 resumes, and compare it with the traditional manual screening method.

2. <s>Optimize the ranking process by eliminating non-fit candidates early to reduce server overload. Suggestion: use required skills as a baseline filter.</s>

3. <s>Highlight the strengths of top-ranking applicants, for example: “Applicant 1 excels in education,” “Applicant 2 excels in experience,” etc., to provide detailed evaluation insights.</s>

4. <s>Indicate in the system and report a limitation: to get a good ranking, the CV must be ATS-compliant, as non-compliant CVs may be under-ranked despite strong qualifications.</s>

5. <s>Clarify whether the system can handle non-traditional candidates (e.g., self-taught or bootcamp graduates who may lack formal education but have extensive portfolios). Suggestion: implement dynamic ranking with downweighting or upweighting of certain criteria.</s>

6. <s>Ensure that individual skill sets assigned by HR are also weighted in the ranking, not just the overall skill criteria, allowing for more nuanced candidate evaluation.</s>
